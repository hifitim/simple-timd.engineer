<p>
Finished the Brothers Karamozov. It got a little dry toward the end, with the defense and prosecution droning on a bit in a fit of "philosophizing".
</p>
<p>
Now I've started The Shape of the Liturgy, by Dom Gregory Dix. The previous owner, one John Richardson of Rice University, apparently only got to page 14, because his multitudinous underlining and margin-note-taking stops abruptly at that point. I've taken it over and will continue his underlining and note-taking for him, hopefully to completion.
</p>

<p>
The garden, having been planted in late February and taken diligent care since then, is now producing fruit! We harvested several excellent cucumbers already, with a handful more to come in the next week or so, to judge by their size. There are several small Homestead and Better Boy tomatoes sprouting as well, which we hope the birds won't eat before we can pick them. The tomatillo plant, which has had a number of bright yellow flowers for several weeks but produced no fruit, needs to be cross-pollinated. Of course, when we bought it, we did buy a second. The girl at the checkout, however, broke it. So it is growing, but I don't think that it will be producing any flowers soon enough for us to use to pollinate the bigger plant. Live and learn, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I spent my "points" that my manager gave me at work for some things that I did, and I ordered a new Yamaha R-S500 stereo. It'll match my S-300 CD player much better than my older (but admittedly still totally functional) RX-797 that I bought second-hand in college.

  <h2>2017/02/26</h2>
  <p>"By interpreting freedom as the propagation and immediate gratification of needs, people distort their own nature, for they engender in themselves a multitude of pointless and foolish desires, habits, and incongruous stratagems. Their lives are motivated only by mutual envy, sensuality, and ostentation. To give dinner-parties, to travel, to have carriages, titles, and slavishly devoted servants is considered such a necessity that, in order to satisfy this need, people will even sacrifice their lives, honour, and sense of humanity, and if they cannot satisfy it, they will even commit suicide."</p>

  <h2>2017/02/19</h2>
  <p>'Always remember, young man,' Father Pa√Øsy began without any preamble, 'that secular science, having become a powerful force, has examined in detail, especially in this last century, everything divine bequeathed to us in the Holy Scriptures, but having subjected all that is holy to such a rigorous analysis the scientists of the world have ended up empty-handed. For in looking at the component parts in isolation they have quite overlooked the whole, and with a truly astounding lack of vision. But the whole stands inviolate before their eyes, as it always has done, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'</p>

<h1>Books to Read</h1>
<h2>2017/02/18</h2>
  <h3>The Karamazov Brothers</h3>
    <p>About 1/3 of the way through. Not as bad as I thought it might be.
    I like this Oxford World's Classic translation. I tried the P&V, and it wasn't as good as I thought it might be. Monks punctuating their theological arguments with "So be it!" instead of "Amen"? "Dmitry Karamazov doesn't exist yet"? No thanks. <br/>
    Also, the pages are away too thin, unfortunately - so the pages have to be kept close together until you're absolutely ready to turn.</p>

    <img src="img/p&v.jpg" />

  <h3>Dialogue Concerning Heresies</h3>
    <p>Not too long, might be dry.</p>
    <img src="img/heresies.jpg" />

  <h3>The Shape of the Liturgy</h3>
    <p>Very long, definitely dry. Also some of his assertions are supposed to be a bit out of date. </p>
    <img src="img/shape.jpg" />

  <h3>Medieval Pilgrims</h3>
    <p>Very short. Scholarly...</p>
    <img src="img/pilgrims.jpg" />

  <h3>TS Eliot: Complete Poems and Plays: 1909-1950</h3>
    <p>I'd like to start going through this at some point.</p>
