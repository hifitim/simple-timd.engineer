  <h1>Sunday</h1>
  <h2>2016/02/19</h2>
  <p>'Always remember, young man,' Father Pa√Øsy began without any preamble, 'that secular science, having become a powerful force, has examined in detail, especially in this last century, everything divine bequeathed to us in the Holy Scriptures, but having subjected all that is holy to such a rigorous analysis the scientists of the world have ended up empty-handed. For in looking at the component parts in isolation they have quite overlooked the whole, and with a truly astounding lack of vision. But the whole stands inviolate before their eyes, as it always has done, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'</p>

      <td class="noborder"><h3>The Karamazov Brothers</h3>
      About 1/3 of the way through. Not as bad as I thought it might be.
      I like this Oxford World's Classic translation. I tried the P&V, and it wasn't as good as I thought it might be. Monks punctuating their theological arguments with "So be it!" instead of "Amen"? "Dmitry Karamazov doesn't exist yet"? No thanks. <br/>
      The pages are way too thin, unfortunately - so the pages have to be kept close together until you're absolutely ready to turn.</td>

      Very long, definitely dry. Also some of his assertions are supposed to be a bit out of date.</td>
