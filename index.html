  <h2>2017/02/19</h2>
  <p>'Always remember, young man,' Father Pa√Øsy began without any preamble, 'that secular science, having become a powerful force, has examined in detail, especially in this last century, everything divine bequeathed to us in the Holy Scriptures, but having subjected all that is holy to such a rigorous analysis the scientists of the world have ended up empty-handed. For in looking at the component parts in isolation they have quite overlooked the whole, and with a truly astounding lack of vision. But the whole stands inviolate before their eyes, as it always has done, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'</p>

  <h3>The Karamazov Brothers</h3>
    <p>About 1/3 of the way through. Not as bad as I thought it might be.
    I like this Oxford World's Classic translation. I tried the P&V, and it wasn't as good as I thought it might be. Monks punctuating their theological arguments with "So be it!" instead of "Amen"? "Dmitry Karamazov doesn't exist yet"? No thanks. <br/>
    Also, the pages are away too thin, unfortunately - so the pages have to be kept close together until you're absolutely ready to turn.</p>

  <h3>Dialogue Concerning Heresies</h3>
    <p>Not too long, might be dry.</p>
    <img src="img/heresies.jpg" />

  <h3>The Shape of the Liturgy</h3>
    <p>Very long, definitely dry. Also some of his assertions are supposed to be a bit out of date. </p>
    <img src="img/shape.jpg" />

  <h3>Medieval Pilgrims</h3>
    <p>Very short. Scholarly...</p>
    <img src="img/pilgrims.jpg" />

  <h3>TS Eliot: Complete Poems and Plays: 1909-1950</h3>
    <p>I'd like to start going through this at some point.</p>
